# data-structures

This repo contains the Python implementation of the main dynamic data structures, like linked lists, stacks, queues, and heaps. Beyond that, this repo contains some graph algorithms.

### data structure info

**Stack** implements a *last-in, first-out* (LIFO) policy. The *insert* operation on a stack is often called `push`, and the *delete* operation, which does not take an element argument, is often called `pop`. Both operation take `O(1)` time.
