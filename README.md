# data-structures

This repo contains the Python implementation of the main dynamic data structures, like linked lists, stacks, queues, and heaps. Beyond that, this repo contains some graph algorithms.

### implementations

- [ ] stack
- [ ] queue
- [ ] linked list
- [ ] heap
- [ ] breadth-first search
- [ ] depth-first search
- [ ] topological sort
- [ ] minimum spanning tree (Kruskal's implementation)
- [ ] shortest-path (Dijkstra's implementation)
